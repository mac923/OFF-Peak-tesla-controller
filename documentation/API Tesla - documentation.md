# What is Fleet API?

Fleet API is a data and command service providing access to Tesla vehicles, energy, and other types of devices. Partners can interact with their own devices, or devices for which they have been granted access by a customer.  
Follow the onboarding process below to register and get an API key to interact with Tesla's API endpoints. Applications can request vehicle owners for permission to view account information, get vehicle status or even issue remote commands. Vehicle owners maintain control over which application they grant access to, and can change these settings at any time.

## Step 1: Create a Tesla Account

Create a Tesla account and ensure it has a verified email and multi-factor authentication enabled.

[Create Account](https://developer.tesla.com/teslaaccount)

## Step 2: Create an Application

Click the button below to request app access. Provide legal business details, application name, description, and purpose of usage.  
While requesting access, select the scopes used by the application. Reference the [authentication overview page](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/authentication/overview#scopes) for a list of available scopes.  
Note: account creation requests can be automatically rejected if the application name already exists.

[Create Application and Access Dashboard](https://developer.tesla.com/dashboard)

## Step 3: Generate a Public/Private Key Pair

A public key must be hosted on the application's domain before making calls to Fleet API.  
The key is used to validate ownership of the domain and provide additional security when using [Vehicle Commands](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/endpoints/vehicle-commands) and [Fleet Telemetry](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/fleet-telemetry).  
To create a private key, run:  
openssl ecparam \-name prime256v1 \-genkey \-noout \-out private-key.pem

Then, generate the associated public key.  
openssl ec \-in private-key.pem \-pubout \-out public-key.pem

This public key should be available at:  
https://developer-domain.com/.well-known/appspecific/com.tesla.3p.public-key.pem

Note: private-key.pem needs to be kept secret and should not be hosted on a domain.

## Step 4: Call the Register Endpoint

Next, generate a [partner authentication token](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/authentication/partner-tokens) and use it to call the [register endpoint](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/endpoints/partner-endpoints#register) to complete registration with Fleet API.

## Next Steps

Now that the register endpoint has been called, Fleet API is configured and ready to receive requests.  
Next steps to take:

* Selecting the proper authentication token type and generating tokens. [Authentication overview](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/authentication/overview).  
* [Pairing a public key to a vehicle](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/virtual-keys/developer-guide#adding-to-a-vehicle). This is required to send [Vehicle Commands](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/endpoints/vehicle-commands) and setup [Fleet Telemetry](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/fleet-telemetry).  
* Configuring [Fleet Telemetry](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/fleet-telemetry) which streams data directly to a server.

# Authentication

API endpoints require an authentication token. It must be included as a header:  
Authorization: Bearer \<token\>

## Token Types

There are four types of tokens, each used with a different purpose. Identifying the proper token type is important. Otherwise, the API will return unexpected responses.  
Choose a token type based on use case.

1. Developers building closed-source software on top of Fleet API that will access user's accounts: [Third-party token](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/authentication/third-party-tokens).  
2. Businesses registered with Tesla for Business looking to interact with their Tesla products: [Partner token](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/authentication/partner-tokens).  
   * Businesses can self-onboard to Tesla for Business by visiting the [self-onboarding page](https://accounts.tesla.com/business/get-started).  
3. Hobbyists looking to interact with their own Tesla products: [Third-party token](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/authentication/third-party-tokens).  
4. Applications authenticating on behalf of a business: [Third-party for Business token](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/authentication/third-party-business-tokens).  
5. All calls to [Partner Endpoints](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/endpoints/partner-endpoints): [Partner token](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/authentication/partner-tokens).

## Scopes

Scopes are used to limit API access to only the data an application needs.

| Name | Scope | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Sign in with Tesla | openid | Allow Tesla customers to sign in to the application with their Tesla credentials. |
| Refresh Tokens | offline\_access | Allow getting a refresh token without needing user to log in again. |
| Profile Information | user\_data | Contact information, home address, profile picture, and referral information. |
| Vehicle Information | vehicle\_device\_data | Allow access to your vehicleâ€™s live data, service history, service scheduling data, service communications, eligible upgrades, nearby Superchargers and ownership details. Note: This permission grants vehicle location data access. In the first quarter of 2025, only the vehicle location permission will control location data access. |
| Vehicle Location | vehicle\_location | Allow access to vehicle location information, including data such as precise location, and coarse location for approximate location services. |
| Vehicle Commands | vehicle\_cmds | Commands like add/remove driver, access Live Camera, unlock, wake up, remote start, and schedule software updates. |
| Vehicle Charging Management | vehicle\_charging\_cmds | Vehicle charging history, billed amount, charging location, commands to schedule, and start/stop charging. |
| Energy Product Information | energy\_device\_data | Energy live status, site info, backup history, energy history, and charge history. |
| Energy Product Settings | energy\_cmds | Update settings like backup reserve percent, operation mode, and storm mode. |

# Developer's Guide to Virtual Keys

A virtual key is a public/private key pair which enables authorization when interacting with a vehicle. The public key must be added to the vehicle by a trusted user and the private key is kept securely on the application's server. Before executing a command or accepting a Fleet Telemetry configuration, the vehicle ensures the payload is signed by a private key whose public key is present on the vehicle.

## Design Explanation

The virtual key provides a crucial layer of protection for users. Adding the key to a vehicle requires a trusted user-in-the-loop, preventing even Tesla's backend from accessing these capabilities. This ensures only authorized parties are able to execute commands or access device data through Fleet Telemetry. If at any time the user wishes to revoke access, they can remove the virtual key from the Locks screen.

## Setup Steps

### Creating a Key Pair

To create a private key, run:  
openssl ecparam \-name prime256v1 \-genkey \-noout \-out private-key.pem

Then, generate the associated public key.  
openssl ec \-in private-key.pem \-pubout \-out public-key.pem

Note: the vehicle only supports prime256v1 keys.

### Hosting the Public Key

This public key must remain available at:  
https://developer-domain.com/.well-known/appspecific/com.tesla.3p.public-key.pem

Note: private-key.pem needs to be kept secret and should never be hosted on a domain.  
After the public key is publicly accessible, call the [Partner Account register](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/endpoints/partner-endpoints#register) endpoint to enroll this key with Tesla.

### Adding to a Vehicle

Applications will have their virtual key added automatically to vehicles purchased through the [B2B program](https://accounts.tesla.com/business/get-started). Note: these vehicles must have fewer than 20 paired keys and must not require the vehicle command protocol; both of these states are present on the [fleet\_status](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/endpoints/vehicle-endpoints#fleet-status) endpoint. Vehicles purchased outside the B2B program do not allow Tesla to remotely add keys. For these cases, the virtual key must be added by a user with vehicle access.  
To request virtual key pairing via the Tesla mobile app:

1. Ensure the user has [authorized the application](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/authentication/third-party-tokens#step-1-user-authorization) and granted the vehicle\_device\_data, vehicle\_cmds, or vehicle\_location scopes.  
2. Direct the user to the key pairing deep link with the Application's domain:

https://tesla.com/\_ak/\*developer-domain.com\*

Users with multiple vehicles can select the vehicle before opening the key paring link, or an optional vin parameter can be added:  
https://tesla.com/\_ak/\*developer-domain.com\*?vin=VIN123

### Removing Key

To remove a key, the user must navigate to the Locks screen in the vehicle and delete the key. Access can also be revoked remotely by revoking the third-party application's access.

## Terminology

* Virtual key: A virtual key is a public/private key pair used by a developer application to securely communicate with a vehicle.  
* Public key: A cryptographic key used by the vehicle to validate a payload comes from a trusted source.  
* Private key: A cryptographic key used by the Vehicle Command Proxy to sign payloads sent to the vehicle. The private key must be kept secret to prevent unauthorized access to the vehicle.  
* Signed commands: A signed command is a command (such as unlock door) which is signed by the application's private key. The easiest method to sign commands is through the Vehicle Command Proxy.

# Vehicle Commands

Vehicle commands allow direct interaction with a vehicle. To accept commands, a vehicle must have an application's virtual key installed. Full details about virtual keys are available in the virtual keys [developer guide](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/virtual-keys/developer-guide). The Vehicle Command Proxy exposes a REST API for sending commands.  
The [Vehicle Command Proxy](https://github.com/teslamotors/vehicle-command) exposes endpoints identical to the ones described below. When it receives a request, it signs the command with a virtual key before passing the request to Fleet API. If a command is not signed, the vehicle will reject the request and perform no action. This ensures unauthorized parties are not able to send commands.  
Note: The Vehicle Commands Proxy is not required for most business vehicles and Pre-2021 S and X vehicles.

# Fleet Telemetry

Fleet Telemetry is the most efficient and effective way of gathering data from vehicles. It allows vehicles to stream data directly to a server, eliminating the need to poll the [vehicle\_data](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/endpoints/vehicle-endpoints#vehicle-data) endpoint. This prevents unnecessary vehicle wakes and battery drain. Fleet Telemetry is not fully equivalent to the vehicle data endpoint but provides important data in an efficient and economical manner. See [Cost Optimization Case Studies](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/billing-and-limits#cost-optimization-case-studies) for details of the cost savings available by using Fleet Telemetry.

## Server Setup

The Fleet Telemetry server must be running on a server exposed to the public internet. The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/teslamotors/fleet-telemetry) has source code and examples of running the server.

## Vehicle Setup

To configure a vehicle, confirm all pre-requisites are met. Then, send a [configure Fleet Telemetry](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/endpoints/vehicle-endpoints#fleet-telemetry-config-create) request through the [vehicle-command](https://github.com/teslamotors/vehicle-command) HTTP proxy. The proxy will sign the configuration using the configured private key and forward the request to Fleet API.

### Prerequisites

For a vehicle to be able to stream data, a few conditions must be met:

* The vehicle must not be a pre-2021 Model S or Model X.  
* Vehicles must be running firmware version 2024.26 or later.  
  * Applications configured with the legacy certificate signing process require 2023.20.6 or later.  
* The [virtual key](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/virtual-keys/developer-guide) is paired with the vehicle.

#### Pairing a Key

To pair a key to the vehicle, direct the user to:  
https://tesla.com/\_ak/developer-domain.com

This will allow the user to add the key to their vehicle through the Tesla mobile app.  
Troubleshooting:

* If receiving a message stating the user has not granted this third-party app access, ensure the user is logged into the Tesla app with the same email used when authorizing the third-party application.  
* If receiving a message stating the application has not registered with Tesla, ensure the [register endpoint](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/endpoints/partner-endpoints#register) has been called for the region the user is located in. This error will also show if the application's public key is no longer available at the /.well-known/ path on the domain used for application registration. This became a requirement [here](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/announcements#2024-02-02-public-key-must-remain-available-for-pairing-continuity).

### Configuring a Vehicle

Once all pre-requisites are met, use the [Fleet Telemetry configure](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/endpoints/vehicle-endpoints#fleet-telemetry-config-create) endpoint to send the desired configuration to the vehicle. Configurations are signed and cannot be edited by Tesla. If a required authorization scope is revoked, making a configuration invalid, the configuration will be removed from the vehicle. A vehicle can be configured to stream data to five third-party applications at a time.  
A full list of fields are available in the open source repository's [vehicle\_data.proto](https://github.com/teslamotors/fleet-telemetry/blob/main/protos/vehicle_data.proto) file. Documentation improvements for available fields are coming soon.  
Note: vehicle\_location scope is required for the following fields: Location, OriginLocation, DestinationLocation, DestinationName, RouteLine, GpsState, GpsHeading

[Configure Vehicle Endpoint](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/endpoints/vehicle-endpoints#fleet-telemetry-config-create)

Troubleshooting:

* If a vehicle is configured and awake, but does not begin streaming, check the following:  
  * Ensure the host and CA in your configuration is compatible with your server using [check\_server\_cert.sh](https://github.com/teslamotors/fleet-telemetry/blob/main/tools/check_server_cert.sh).  
  * Ensure the application public key is present on the vehicle using the [fleet\_status](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/endpoints/vehicle-endpoints#fleet-status) endpoint. Note: the key state reported in this endpoint may have some lag.

## System Behavior

Fleet Telemetry consists of two event loops:

1. The event collector gathers data in 500 millisecond buckets. Once 500 milliseconds has elapsed, all fields that have emitted values are delivered to the remote server.  
2. Each field's value is only sent to the event collector once two conditions are met: interval\_seconds has elapsed since the field was last emitted and the field's value has changed.

System state transitions:  
Assume the "VehicleSpeed" field is being streamed with interval\_seconds set to 1.

| Time | Event | Action |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 0ms | Process starts. | Begin listening for field changes. All fields are received shortly after startup. In this case, speed is received at 100ms. |
| 100ms | Receive speed of 0mph. | Immediately push to event collector since no value has been seen previously. |
| 500ms | Event collector loop triggers. | Vehicle speed is sent from event collector to remote server. |
| 600ms | Speed changes to 1mph. | The value is not pushed to event collector since interval\_seconds has not elapsed. |
| 1000ms | Event collector loop triggers. | No data is sent to remote server since no updated fields received. |
| 1100ms | Speed changes to 2mph. | The value is not pushed to event collector since interval\_seconds has not elapsed. The previous value of 1mph is discarded. |
| 1300ms | interval\_seconds has elapsed. | Immediately push data to event collector since speed has changed since last publish (from 0mph to 2mph). |
| 1500ms | Event collector loop triggers. | Speed of 2mph is sent. |
| 2000ms | Event collector loop triggers. | No data is sent to remote server since no updated fields received. |
| 2300ms | interval\_seconds has elapsed. | Nothing is pushed to the event collector since speed has not changed. |
| 2400ms | Speed changes to 3mph. | Immediately push to the event collector since interval\_seconds has already elapsed. |
| 2500ms | Event collector loop triggers. | Speed of 3mph is sent. |

Failure handling:

* Loss of connectivity: the vehicle will buffer 5000 messages which is at least 2,500 seconds of data. Once reconnected, all messages will be delivered.  
* Server disconnect: the vehicle will buffer messages, as described above. It will attempt to reconnect in an exponential backoff with a maximum retry delay of 30 seconds.  
* A vehicle's connectivity state can be monitored through Fleet Telemetry [connectivity events](https://github.com/teslamotors/fleet-telemetry?tab=readme-ov-file#detecting-vehicle-connectivity-changes).

## Example Configuration Pricing Analysis

This is a sample configuration which collects data from the most commonly used fields when building applications.  
{  
    "fields": {  
        "VehicleSpeed": { "interval\_seconds": 10 },  
        "Location": { "interval\_seconds": 10 },  
        "Soc": { "interval\_seconds": 60 },  
        "DoorState": { "interval\_seconds": 1 },  
        "Odometer": { "interval\_seconds": 60 },  
        "Locked": { "interval\_seconds": 1 },  
        "EstBatteryRange": { "interval\_seconds": 60 },  
        "ChargeAmps": { "interval\_seconds": 1 },  
        "DetailedChargeState": { "interval\_seconds": 1 },  
        "VehicleName": { "interval\_seconds": 1 },  
        "TpmsPressureFl": { "interval\_seconds": 1 },  
        "TpmsPressureFr": { "interval\_seconds": 1 },  
        "TpmsPressureRl": { "interval\_seconds": 1 },  
        "TpmsPressureRr": { "interval\_seconds": 1 },  
        "TpmsLastSeenPressureTimeFl": { "interval\_seconds": 1 },  
        "TpmsLastSeenPressureTimeFr": { "interval\_seconds": 1 },  
        "TpmsLastSeenPressureTimeRl": { "interval\_seconds": 1 },  
        "TpmsLastSeenPressureTimeRr": { "interval\_seconds": 1 }  
    }  
}  
During regular driving, a small subset of the desired fields are regularly streamed thanks to change based streaming [described above](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/fleet-telemetry#data-collection-interval).

* VehicleSpeed: 6 signals per minute  
* Location: 6 signals per minute  
* Soc: 1 signal per minute  
* Odometer: 1 signal per minute  
* EstBatteryRange: 1 signal per minute  
* Remaining fields: not streamed regularly

This results in approximately 15 signals streamed per minute of driving, yielding a cost of $0.0001/minute or $0.006/hour.  
The other fields are streamed on vehicle startup and infrequently as the value changes. For this estimation, generously assume each field is streamed 3 extra times per hour. This results in 18 \* 3 \= 54 additional signals, yielding a cost of $0.00036/hour.  
For this basic configuration, an hour of driving would cost about $0.00636.

## Changelog

  * A new configuration option delivery\_policy has been introduced. When set to latest, the vehicle will resend data which is not acknowledged by the server. When data is resent, all un-acked data will be resent. This requires Fleet Telemetry server version 0.7.1 or later.  
  * Location fields now support minimum\_delta. Changes in distance are measured in meters.  
  * The vehicle now publishes its Fleet Telemetry client version on connection and through the [fleet status](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/endpoints/vehicle-endpoints#fleet-status) endpoint.

# Third-Party Tokens

Use the authorization\_code grant flow to generate a token on behalf of a customer. This allows API calls using the [scopes](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/authentication/overview#scopes) granted by the customer. Authentication endpoints are not billed.

## Step 1: User Authorization

To initiate the authorization code flow, direct the customer to an /authorize request.  
https://fleet-auth.prd.vn.cloud.tesla.com/oauth2/v3/authorize

### Parameters

| Name | Required | Example | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| response\_type | Yes | code | A string, always use the value "code". |
| client\_id | Yes | abc-123 | Partner application client ID. |
| redirect\_uri | Yes | https://example.com/auth/callback | Partner application callback url, spec: [rfc6749](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-3.1.2). |
| scope | Yes | openid offline\_access user\_data vehicle\_device\_data vehicle\_cmds vehicle\_charging\_cmds | Space delimited list of [scopes](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/authentication/overview#scopes), include openid and offline\_access to obtain a refresh token. |
| state | Yes | db4af3f87... | Random value used for validation. |
| nonce | No | 7baf90cda... | Random value used for replay prevention. |
| prompt\_missing\_scopes | No | true or false | When true, the user will be prompted to authorize scopes, if they have not already granted all required scopes. |
| require\_requested\_scopes | No | true or false | When true, the user must authorize all requested scopes to proceed. |
| show\_keypair\_step | No | true or false | Inform users there will be a second step in the authorization flow for virtual key pairing. This is meant to be used for cases where an application immediately redirects users to virtual key paring after receiving the authorization code callback. |

### Example Request

https://fleet-auth.prd.vn.cloud.tesla.com/oauth2/v3/authorize?\&client\_id=$CLIENT\_ID\&locale=en-US\&prompt=login\&redirect\_uri=$REDIRECT\_URI\&response\_type=code\&scope=openid%20vehicle\_device\_data%20offline\_access\&state=$STATE

## Step 2: Callback

After the user authorizes their account with Tesla, they will be redirected to the specified redirect\_uri.  
Extract the code URL parameter from this callback.

## Step 3: Code Exchange

Execute a code exchange call to generate a token. The access\_token can be used for subsequent requests to Fleet API on behalf of the user.  
If using the offline\_access scope, save the refresh\_token to generate tokens in the future. The refresh token is single use only and expires after 3 months.  
An invalid\_auth\_code response likely means the code is expired.  
POST https://fleet-auth.prd.vn.cloud.tesla.com/oauth2/v3/token

### Parameters

| Name | Required | Example | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| grant\_type | Yes | authorization\_code | Grant type must be authorization\_code. |
| client\_id | Yes | abc-123 | Partner application client ID. |
| client\_secret | Yes | secret-password | Partner application client secret. |
| audience | Yes | [https://fleet-api.prd.na.vn.cloud.tesla.com](https://fleet-api.prd.na.vn.cloud.tesla.com/) | Audience for the generated token. Must be a Fleet API [base URL](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/getting-started/regions-countries#base-urls-by-region). |
| redirect\_uri | Yes | https://example.com/auth/callback | Partner application callback url, spec: [rfc6749](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-3.1.2). |
| scope | No | openid offline\_access user\_data vehicle\_device\_data vehicle\_cmds vehicle\_charging\_cmds | Space-delimited list of [scopes](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/authentication/overview#scopes). |

### Example Request

\# Authorization code token request  
CODE=\<extract from callback\>  
curl \--request POST \\  
  \--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\  
  \--data-urlencode 'grant\_type=authorization\_code' \\

  'https://fleet-auth.prd.vn.cloud.tesla.com/oauth2/v3/token'  
\# Extract access\_token and refresh\_token from this response

## Refresh Tokens

Use the refresh token to generate a new access token and refresh token. When exchanging a refresh token, ensure the new refresh token is saved for use on the next exchange. To support cases where applications fail to save a new refresh token, the most recently used refresh token is valid for up to 24 hours.  
There are two common failure modes for refresh token exchange that return a 401 \- login\_required response:

1. The refresh token is expired or has been cycled out by newer refresh tokens.  
2. The user has reset their password.

### Parameters

| Name | Required | Example | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| grant\_type | Yes | refresh\_token | Grant type must be refresh\_token. |
| client\_id | Yes | abc-123 | Partner application client ID. |
| refresh\_token | Yes | NA\_a90869e9d... | Refresh token from the code exchange response. |

## Scope Changes

Once a user has granted scopes to an application, they can modify scopes or revoke access using the consent management page:  
https://auth.tesla.com/user/revoke/consent?revoke\_client\_id=$CLIENT\_ID\&back\_url=$RETURN\_URL  
Scope modifications are compatible with existing refresh tokens and will be applied to new access tokens.  
Scope additions can be made by sending the user an [/authorize](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/authentication/third-party-tokens#step-1-user-authorization) link with prompt\_missing\_scopes=true

# Vehicle Endpoints

## Endpoints

### drivers

GET /api/1/vehicles/{vehicle\_tag}/drivers  
Returns all allowed drivers for a vehicle. This endpoint is only available for the vehicle owner.

### drivers remove

DELETE /api/1/vehicles/{vehicle\_tag}/drivers  
Removes driver access from a vehicle. Share users can only remove their own access. Owners can remove share access or their own.

### eligible\_subscriptions

GET /api/1/dx/vehicles/subscriptions/eligibility?vin={vin}  
Returns eligible vehicle subscriptions.

### eligible\_upgrades

GET /api/1/dx/vehicles/upgrades/eligibility?vin={vin}  
Returns eligibile vehicle upgrades.

### fleet\_status

POST /api/1/vehicles/fleet\_status  
Checks whether vehicles can accept Tesla commands protocol for the partner's public key. Also returns the version of the Fleet Telemetry client the vehicle is running. When called with one vin, discounted\_device\_data state is also returned. Calling with one vin is recommended.

### fleet\_telemetry\_config create

POST /api/1/vehicles/fleet\_telemetry\_config  
Configures vehicles to connect to a self-hosted [fleet-telemetry](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/fleet-telemetry) server. This endpoint should be called through the Vehicle Command Proxy. The configured private key will be used to sign the configuration. The endpoint can be used to create or update configurations.  
Available fields are described on the [Available Data](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/fleet-telemetry/available-data) page.  
Note: legacy applications configured using a CSR may still call this endpoint directly. It is recommended to transition to using the vehicle-command proxy.  
If any specified VINs are not configured, the response will include skipped\_vehicles. VINs may be rejected for a few reasons:

* missing\_key: The virtual key has not been added to the vehicle. [Distributing a public key](https://github.com/teslamotors/vehicle-command?tab=readme-ov-file#distributing-your-public-key).  
* unsupported\_hardware: Pre-2021 Model S and X are not supported.  
* unsupported\_firmware:  
  * If calling directly, vehicles running firmware version earlier than 2023.20.  
  * If using the vehicle-command HTTP proxy, vehicles running firmware version earlier than 2024.26.  
* max\_configs: Vehicles that already have five configurations present.

Fleet Telemetry configuration will automatically be removed if a user revokes an application's access.

### fleet\_telemetry\_config delete

DELETE /api/1/vehicles/{vehicle\_tag}/fleet\_telemetry\_config  
Remove a fleet telemetry configuration from a vehicle. Removes the configuration for any vehicle if called with a partner token.

### fleet\_telemetry\_config get

GET /api/1/vehicles/{vehicle\_tag}/fleet\_telemetry\_config

Note that if vehicle only allows 3 partners per vehicle for streaming via fleet telemetry. If limit\_reached set to true, vehicle has reached max supported applications and new fleet streaming requests cannot be added to the vehicle

### fleet\_telemetry\_config\_jws

POST /api/1/vehicles/fleet\_telemetry\_config\_jws  
Configures vehicles to connect to a self-hosted [fleet-telemetry](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/fleet-telemetry) server by accepting a signed configuration token.  
It is not recommended to use this endpoint directly.  
The recommended approach for configuring vehicles is calling the [fleet\_telemetry\_config create](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/endpoints/vehicle-endpoints#fleet-telemetry-config-create) endpoint through the [vehicle-command](https://github.com/teslamotors/vehicle-command) proxy. This will automatically sign the configuration using the configured private key and forward the request to this endpoint.  
If using this endpoint directly, the JWS token must be crafted using a Schnorr signatures algorithm using [NIST P-256](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/events/workshop-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography-standards/documents/papers/session6-adalier-mehmet.pdf) and SHA-256.  
VINs may be rejected for a few reasons:

* missing\_key: The virtual key has not been added to the vehicle. [Distributing a public key](https://github.com/teslamotors/vehicle-command?tab=readme-ov-file#distributing-your-public-key).  
* unsupported\_hardware: Pre-2021 Model S and X are not supported.  
* unsupported\_firmware: Vehicles running firmware version earlier than 2024.26.
